# Sarcasm Detection with Deep Learning

**Abstract:**
Sarcasm has been considered one of the most difficult challenges in Natural Language
Processing. In this paper, we show several methods of categorizing sarcasm, using both machine
learning models and deep learning models. We find that of the machine learning models, logistic
regression was the most effective, with accuracy rates up to 83% on various datasets. We then
explore several deep learning models and find that using convoluted neural networks was the
most effective, with accuracy rates consistently up to 72%.
